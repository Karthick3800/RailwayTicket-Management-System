# Railway Ticket Management System

This project is a console-based Railway Ticket Management System developed in Java. It allows users to book and cancel railway tickets, check available tickets, and view booked tickets. The system handles different types of berths (lower, middle, upper), RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation), and waiting lists.

## Features

- **Book Ticket**: Allows users to book a ticket with berth preferences.
- **Cancel Ticket**: Allows users to cancel a booked ticket.
- **Check Availability**: Displays the number of available lower, middle, upper berths, RAC, and waiting list positions.
- **View Booked Tickets**: Displays the details of all booked passengers.

You will be presented with a menu to choose different actions:
- Book Ticket
- Cancel Ticket
- Available Tickets
- Booked Tickets
- Exit
